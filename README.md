#  Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network for Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network for predicting housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The RBF Neural Network leverages Gaussian activation functions and K-Means clustering to model the relationships between housing features and prices.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate a Radial Basis Function Neural Network that predicts housing prices based on various features. The project covers key steps including data preprocessing, center selection using K-Means clustering, hidden layer activation computation, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbf-neural-network.git
   cd rbf-neural-network
Running the Code

Open the rbf_neural_network.ipynb Jupyter Notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the code implementation and explanations.


Experiment with different parameters, settings, or additional data for further exploration.

### Usage
